# Basic_Tableau_Project
In this project, I created an interactive Tableau dashboard, showing worldwide covid data from 2020-2023.

Skills used:
- creating a database and table in sql
- import data into sql, query data of interest and export query
- create dashboard in Tableau with maps, calculated fields, filters and filter actions.

The final dashboard can be found here:
